Objectives:    
Create an application from scratch with an interesting user interface using what you learned in the 
User Interface Classes Lesson. This application's user interface is composed of geometric shapes 
arranged in a particular order. Its layout inspired by the works of Modern Art masters such as 
Piet Mondrian and Ben Nicholson. If you'd like to learn more about this modern art and artists 
take a look at this website created by our collaborators at the Museum of Modern Art in New York
(requires free signup to MoMA's Virtual Gallery for Mobile Cloud Computing with Android). 

The application's user interface has one area containing multiple colored rectangles and 
another containing a SeekBar.
When the user drags the SeekBar, all rectangles gradually change their color. 

This application also contains an Options Menu.
When the user clicks on the options menu an option labeled, "More Information" appears. 
When the user clicks on the "More Information" option, a Dialog appears displaying some text
and two Buttons. 
If the user clicks on the "Not Now" Button in the Dialog, the Dialog should be dismissed. 
If the user clicks on the "Visit MOMA" Button, then the Web Browser should be opened 
to view a web page on the MoMA.org web site.
